\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Setting up the Web Server}
Some minor setup is necessary in order to run the web server, however the process is drastically
simplified when taking advantage of some serendipitous Python tools. Firstly, Python 3 will be
required. Furthermore, it is recommended to use
\href{https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/}{\texttt{virtualenv}} to keep dependencies managed.
Finally, this tutorial will be assuming the user has access to the free open-source Python package
manager, \href{https://pypi.org/project/pip}{\texttt{pip}}.\\\\
Firstly, navigate to the \texttt{api/} directory in this project's root. It is strongly recommended
to create a \texttt{virtualenv} here, but it is not necessary. Next, execute the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,basicstyle=\ttfamily]
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
\end{lstlisting}
This will install all Python package dependencies required for the project. With these dependencies
installed, the server is ready to run! Execute the following command, still within the \texttt{api/}
directory:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,basicstyle=\ttfamily]
$ python api.py
\end{lstlisting}
The command above launches the web server on port 5000. The server will run indefinitely. When it is
desired to kill the server, navigate to the shell through which the server is being run and press
\texttt{CTRL + C}.\\\\
Note that for the end-to-end pipeline
described in this paper, the Android application must be configured to send HTTP packets to the IP
of the machine running this server. In order to do this, navigate to the file at:\\
\texttt{<project root>/android/app/src/main/java/com/ecse426/project/app/AppController.java}\\\\
In this file, edit the string \texttt{WEBSITE\_ADDRESS} to contain the IP address of the machine
running the server. For the changes to take effect, the Android app must be rebuilt and reinstalled
on an Android device.
