\begin{abstract}
This report outlines the engineering process we used while completing Labs 3 \& 4. These most recent labs built upon the ADC sampling, filtering and 7-segment display work done previously as part of Lab 2. The main objective of this lab was to create a system which accepts user input through a keypad, and then attempts to match the given value (a RMS voltage) by using a PWM signal. This system also had to successfully manage the transitions between the different states of operation (sleep, keypad input, voltage matching), all-the-while conserving CPU resources as much as possible. The system was first created using an interrupt-driven approach (Lab3), and later using the multithreaded paradigms of the CMSIS\_RTOS framework (Lab4). Despite some portions of this lab presenting a significant technical challenge, it can be considered a resounding success, as all of its objectives were successfully completed. While our current solution makes a great effort towards CPU efficiency, additional measures could be taken in order to reduce the power consumption even further.
