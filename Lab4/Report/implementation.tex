\section{Implementation}

This section will describe the design and engineering processes that were used while implementing our system, based on the requirements described above. In order to simplify and structure its description, the system will first be broken down into its different logical components.


\subsection{High-Level System Architecture}
The various requirements and corresponding program functionality of our system can be broken down into four main areas: the 7-segment display, the keypad, the ADC and the PWM timer. Despite the overall system having significant complexity, there is a very limited number of states for the overall system, with the transition between them being very well defined. A state diagram showing the three states, along with the name of their transitions can be seen in Figure \ref{high_level_state_diagram}.

   \node[state,initial] (sleep)  {$Sleep$}; 
   \node[state] (input_target)	[below right=of sleep]	{$Input$}; 
   \node[state] (match_voltage) 	[below left=of sleep]	{$Match $};
   \path[->] 
   		(sleep) edge [bend left] node {WakeUp()} (input_target)
        (input_target) edge node {Sleep()} (sleep)
        (input_target) edge [bend left] node {StartMatching()} (match_voltage)
        (input_target) edge [loop below] node {Reset()} ()
        (match_voltage) edge [bend left] node {Sleep()} (sleep)
        (match_voltage) edge node {Reset()} (input_target)
    ;  
\end{tikzpicture}

\begin{tabular}{ p{4cm} | p{4cm} | p{4cm}}
Sleep & Input & Match \\
\hline
% Sleep state description 
The sleep state (blabla)
&
% Input state description
The Input state (blabla)

&
% Match state state description
The Match state is (blabla)

\end{tabular}

\begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt,node distance=3cm,on grid,auto] 
\node[state,initial] (off)  {$Off$};
\node[state] [below=of off] (digit_1) {$Digit\_1$};
\node[state] [left=of digit_1] (digit_0) {$Digit\_0$}; 
\node[state] [right=of digit_1] (digit_2) {$Digit\_2$};
\path[->]
	(off) edge node {$start\_display()$} (digit_0);
